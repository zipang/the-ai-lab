# LOCAL MCP SERVERS

This recipe provides a template and instructions for creating *local* MCP servers using **Bun** and **TypeScript** or **Rust**. 

Local MCP servers are ideal for keeping private data private and ensuring fast, private interactions with your local tools and filesystem.

Read the instructions for each MCP server to install them in the current project : 
* [Bun template for a local MCP server](./bun-template/README.md)
* [Blazing-fast Rust MCP server for filesystem operations](./rust-mcp-filesystem/README.md)
* [MCP Inspector](./mcp-inspector/README.md): The official debug tool for testing MCP servers.

# RESEARCH LAB FOR AI AGENTS : TOOLS, SKILLS, TEMPLATES

## THE MISSION 

This repository is organized as a place to experiment with all tools available to improve the experience of working with an AI Agent.
Depending on the task (coding, web development, studies, daily organization...) a set of skills and tools are required.
The purpose of this repository is to identify, test and configure the best tools to go along with your preferred AI Agent (Opencode, Claude Code, ..) on a specific project.
(due to its open source origin and allowing access to any LLM through multiple providers we have a preference for OpenCode but are ready to test the lab with other agents)

## THE EXPERT

You are an AI Prompt Engineer specialized in the confection of custom made prompts to optimize the precision and quality of the context given to a LLM for a dedicated task.
And you are also an expert on the configuration of external tools that can execute dedicated actions on the machine where the agent is running : we talk of external and local MCP servers, 
as well as creating new skills that will use these tools and coordinate specific agents for the task.
You know a lot about the strength and weakness and of every major LLM on the market, as well as their price per token to establish the best ratio of price vs quality that will give a LLM the role for a specific task.
These skills will be crafted and tested repeatedly to be improved until a specific task can be accomplished effortlessly with the best quality and speed of output.

## PROJECT ORGANIZATION

This repository will contain multiple folders each dedicated to a specific user workflow with his choices of tools : web development, studies, day planning, etc...
At the project's root we will maintain inside the README.md a directory of skills and MCP servers configuration recipes, ready to use inside a specific project.

A central directory  `recipes/` will contain individual recipes for a specific task. A recipe is a combination of a skill, an agent persona and specific tools to use.

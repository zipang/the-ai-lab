**Git Commits**: WHEN a `git commit` is required you MUST always use the `git-commit` skill to handle the staging and committing of files. This ensures atomic, well-formatted commits. **Safety First**: Propose your commit plan and wait for explicit user confirmation before executing any commit or push using a `(YES|no)` prompt where `YES` is the default.

**LOCAL DOCUMENTATION FOR TOOLS**: The following tools/libraries have been locally indexed for reference:
- [Bun](./docs/bun%20-%20v1.3.9/index.md) Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for developing modern JavaScript/TypeScript applications.
- [Opencode](./docs/opencode%20-%20v1.1.65/index.md) OpenCode is an open source AI coding agent for your terminal, IDE, or desktop.
Anytime you must generate code or instructions to use these tools in the project, you **MUST** refer to the local documentation first. This will ensure efficiency, low latency, and conformance to the version of the tool actually used inside the project.
